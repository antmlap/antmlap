# Hi, I'm Anthony!

UF Honors • URSP Research Scholar • Computer Science @ University of Florida

I'm a software engineer and CS student interested in systems engineering, computer vision, algorithms, and full-stack development. I like building projects from first principles — whether that means designing a lane-keeping system in C++, writing an arbitrage engine in Python, or creating full-stack production applications.

I am part of the University Research Scholars Program (0.3 percent acceptance rate) and the UF Honors Program, and I graduated high school as Salutatorian with a 10.44 GPA.

## Featured Projects

### MiniPilot — Lane-Keeping Assist Simulation (C++ / OpenCV) https://github.com/antmlap/miniPilot

End-to-end lane-keeping system built using classical computer vision and control theory. Includes lane detection (Canny, Hough, ROI masking, lane classification, temporal smoothing), a tunable PID controller with anti-windup and output limits, and a physics-based bicycle model. Supports real-time visualization, video input, and telemetry logging.
Tech: C++, OpenCV


### Kalshi Arbitrage Bot — Automated Market Scanner (Python) https://github.com/antmlap/kalshi-arbitrage-bot

A production-ready engine that identifies arbitrage and instant-profit opportunities across prediction markets. Implements a rate-limited REST API client, retry logic, fee and payout modeling, liquidity screening, and ranked-opportunity detection.
Tech: Python, REST APIs


### ArmoLingo.com — Full-Stack Language Learning Platform https://www.armolingo.com/

An Armenian language-learning platform with interactive quizzes, dialect switching, JWT authentication, bcrypt hashing, and Redis rate-limiting.
Tech: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Redis


### HabitPilot (iOS) https://github.com/antmlap/HabitPilot

An AI-powered habit tracking app with personalized routines and social challenge features.
Tech: Node.js, PostgreSQL, OpenAI API

## Leadership and Teaching

I have a strong background in competitive chess, competing in 37 rated tournaments and placing first in my section at the 2021 National Open in Las Vegas. I founded Lapsley Academy, where my instructional videos surpassed 100,000 views. I also created an AP Computer Science A cram course and taught Java to students in more than ten countries, later hosting a live review for over 150 students.
