# 👋 Hi, I'm Anthony Lapsley

🎓 UF Honors + URSP Computer Science 

---

I'm an engineer and computer scientist with a passion for entrepreneurship.

I grew up as a competitive chess player, competing in 37 rated tournaments and placing **1st in my section** at the **2021 National Open** in Las Vegas. I used my skills to launch Lapsley Academy, originally a chess coaching company where I shared content online — some videos received over 100,000 views.

In 2021, I moved to Florida and founded my high school's chess club to rebuild that same community. In 2023, I became a **certified USCF tournament director** and began hosting officially ranked tournaments.

I soon learned that Chess and computer science go hand in hand — both require logic, creativity, and foresight.

In 2024, I noticed classmates struggling in AP Computer Science A (Java). So I created and taught a **Java cram course**, helping them prep for the AP exam. I later hosted a **webinar for hundreds of students** in Gohar Khan’s CS community.

In 2025, I graduated as **Salutatorian** of my high school with a **10.44 GPA**, which had been unseen in previous years (Also you should check out my speech on LinkedIn). I was accepted into the **UF Honors Program**, which that year had admission standards comparable to Ivy Leagues — and I was also selected for the **University Research Scholars Program (URSP)**, offered to the **top 2%** of admitted students.

📊 URSP Acceptance Rate: 0.3% of total UF applicants — 10x more selective than Harvard
